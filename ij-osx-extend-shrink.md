Practice keyboard shortcuts to extend and shrink selected text while editing a Java source file.

### Kata: Extend/shrink selection

Key sequences to practice:

- ⌥↑ (Option + Up Arrow) - extend selection
- ⌥↓ (Option + Down Arrow) - shrink selection


Steps

1. Open the file src/main/java/com/neopragma/idekatas/LongConditional.java
1. Select a single token anywhere in the source file.
1. Press ⌥↑ (Option + Up Arrow) repeatedly and watch the selection expand to larger scopes.
1. Press ⌥↓ (Option + Down Arrow) repeatedly and watch the selection shrink back down to the originally-selected token.
