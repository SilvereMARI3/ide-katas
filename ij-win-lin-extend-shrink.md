# IntelliJ IDEA on Windows/Linux: Extend/shrink selection

Practice keyboard shortcuts to extend and shrink selected text while editing a Java source file.

### Kata: Extend/shrink selection

Key sequences to practice:

- (Ctrl + W) - extend selection (when something is selected)
- (Ctrl + Shift + W) - shrink selection

Steps

1. Open the file src/main/java/com/neopragma/idekatas/LongConditional.java
1. Select a single token anywhere in the source file.
1. Press (Ctrl + W) repeatedly and watch the selection expand to larger scopes.
1. Press (Ctrl + Shift + W) repeatedly and watch the selection shrink back down to the originally-selected token.
1. Repeat until bored.
