  2. Code Style Scheme
  3. Keymap
  4. View Mode
  5. Look and Feel
- ⇧⌘] (Shift + Command + ]) - editor tab to the right
- ⇧⌘[ (Shift + Command + [) - editor tab to the left
- ⌘] (Command + ]) - next editor tab in history
- ⌘[ (Command + [) - previous editor tab in history


**Toggle various panes**

- ⌘0 (Command + 0) - toggle messages pane
- ⌘1 (Command + 1) - toggle project view
- ⌘2 (Command + 2) - toggle favorites view
- ⌘4 (Command + 4) - toggle run view
- ⌘6 (Command + 6) - toggle TODO view
- ⌘7 (Command + 7) - toggle structure view
- ⌘9 (Command + 9) - toggle version control view
- ⌘; (Command + Semicolon) - open Project Structure dialog
- ⌘, (Command + Comma) - open Preferences dialog
- ⌘E (Command + E) - show list of recently-opened files

You can press ⎋ (Escape) or ⌘W (Command + W) to close whichever view has focus.

**Procedure**

Repeat these key sequences until you feel you can remember them reasonably well.

**Use Switcher to navigate between panes**

- Press and hold ⌃⇥ (Ctrl) and press ⇥ (Tab) to open the Switcher dialog. When you release the (Ctrl) key, the dialog closes.
- The Switcher dialog has two panes. The left-hand pane has a list of navigation options corresponding to the key sequences listed above. Try them.
- The right-hand pane has a list of all open editor table. Use the ↓ (Down Arrow) and ↑ (Up Arrow) keys to move through the list. Press ⏎ (Return/Enter) to make a selection. Focus moves to the selected editor tab.
- With Switcher open, you can press ⌫ (Return/Backspace) to close an open file and remove it from the list. Handy way to close selected files.

**Change viewing modes**

JetBrains IDEs offer standard, distraction-free, and presentation viewing modes.

- Press ⌃` (Ctrl + Backtick) to open the mode switching dialog. This dialog behaves differently than the Switcher. It will remain open until you make a selection from the list. Use ↓ (Down Arrow) and ↑ (Up Arrow) to highlight the viewing mode you want and press ⏎ (Return/Enter), or press the number key corresponding to the menu option you want.
- Choose 4 to change the view mode. Select from the available options.

**Navigating across editor tabs**

- ⇧⌘] (Shift + Command + ]) - moves focus to the editor tab to the right of the current tab
- ⇧⌘[ (Shift + Command + [) - moves focus to the editor tab to the left of the current tab
- ⌘] (Command + ]) - moves focus forward through the "history" of your work in open editor tabs
- ⌘[ (Command + [) - moves focus backward through the "history" of your work in open editor tabs

**Using the IDE without editor tabs**

If you are not using editor tabs, use Switcher to navigate between open files as described above.
