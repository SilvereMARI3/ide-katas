# JetBrains IntelliJ IDEA on Mac OS X

### Kata: Navigate through tokens

The default mapping for ⇧F6 in OS X is "move focus to the floating window." The default mapping for ⇧F6 in Intellij IDEA is "Rename". I suggest changing the IntelliJ IDEA mapping for Rename to ⌃F6 (Ctrl + F6), which is really fn⌃F6 (Fn + Ctrl +F6) on the physical Mac keyboard.

There is nothing to be gained by having separate _kata_ to practice renaming files, directories, packages, etc. because the keystrokes are the same.

**Key sequences to practice**

- ⌥→ (Option + Right Arrow) - Move forward through text one token at a time
- ⌥← (Option + Left Arrow) - Move backward through text one token at a time

**Keystrokes without explanations**

- Open the Java source file, LongConditional.java.
-
- Repeat the following keyboard inputs until the sequence becomes fluid.
```
⌥→ →  →
⌥← ← ←
```

1. Open the Java source file, LongConditional.java.
1. Press ⌥→ (Option + Right Arrow), pressing → (Right Arrow) repeatedly while holding down ⌥ (Option), to skip foward through the text one token at a time.
1. Press ⌥← (Option + Left Arrow), pressing ← (Left Arrow) repeatedly while holding down ⌥ (Option), to skip backward through the text one token at a time.
1. Repeat until bored.
