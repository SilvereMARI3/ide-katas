# IntelliJ IDEA on Mac OS X: Find in path

Practice keyboard shortcuts to find and replace text in various scopes.

When JetBrains products refer to a "path" in this context, they mean a search path. You can search for objects in a Project, Module, Directory, or Scope. In this case _scope_ means a set of objects that have something in common, such as "all open files" or "everything pertaining to _test_".
