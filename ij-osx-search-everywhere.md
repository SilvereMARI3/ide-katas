# IntelliJ IDEA on Mac OS X: Search everywhere

Practice keyboard shortcuts to search "everywhere" for objects.

This quick search option looks "everywhere" for text. "Everywhere" includes libraries that are on the project classpath, so you may get far more results than you expect. When you aren't sure what scope to look in, then this option will probably find what you're searching for.

### Kata: Find text in project

Key sequences to practice:

- ⇧⇧

Steps

1. Tap ⇧ (Shift) twice to open the "search everywhere" dialog.
1. Tap ⇧ (Shift) twice again to toggle "include non-project items".
1. Press Esc to dismiss the dialog.
