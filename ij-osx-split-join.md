Kata for practicing keyboard shortcuts for common editing operations

### Kata: Splitting and joining lines

**Key sequences to practice**

- ⌘↖︎ (Command + Home) or fn⌘← (Fn + Command + Left Arrow) - move the caret to the beginning of the file
- ↓ (Down Arrow) - move the caret down one line
- ⌥→ (Option + Right Arrow) - advance through the text word by word
- ⏎ (Return/Enter) or ⌘⏎ (Command + Return/Enter) - split line at current caret position
- ⌃⇧J (Ctrl + Shift + J) - append the next line to the end of the current line

**Keystrokes without explanations**

- Open the text file, rain-in-spain.txt.
- Repeat the following keyboard inputs until the sequence becomes fluid.
```
⌘↖︎

1. Press ⌘↖︎ (Command + Home) or fn⌘← (Fn + Command + Left Arrow) to move the caret to the beginning of the file.
1. Press ↓ (Down Arrow) twice to move the caret to the beginning of the line that reads, "The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog."
1. Hold down ⌥ (Option) and press → (Right Arrow) four times to move the caret after the word, "fox".
1. Press ⌘⏎ (Command + Enter) for "smart" split, or just ⏎ (Return/Enter), to split the line after the word "fox".
1. Press ↓ (Down Arrow) three times to position the caret on the line about "life".
