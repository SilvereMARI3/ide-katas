# IntelliJ IDEA on Mac OS X: Open/close files, navigate between editor tabs

Practice keyboard shortcuts to open and close files in editor tabs and to navigate between editor tabs.

### Kata: Open files, navigate between editor tabs, close files

Key sequences to practice:

- ⌘N (Command +N) - create new file
- ⌘⇧O (Command + Shift + O) - navigate to file
- ⌘⌥O (Command + Option + O) - navigate to symbol
- ⌘O (Command + O) - navigate to class declaration
- ⌘W (Command + W) - close editor tab
- ⌃→ (Ctrl + Right Arrow) - go to next editor tab *
- ⌃← (Ctrl + Left Arrow) - go to previous editor tab *

* In case ⌃→ and ⌃← conflict with OS X key mappings:

- ⌘⇧] (Command + Shift + Right Square Bracket) - go to next editor tab
- ⌘⇧[ (Command + Shift + Left Square Bracket) - go to previous editor tab

Steps
